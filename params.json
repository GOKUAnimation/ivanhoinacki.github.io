It is not designed for production.\r\nIt exists primarily to get you started quickly with learning and prototyping in Angular 2**\r\n\r\nWe are unlikely to accept suggestions about how to grow this QuickStart into something it is not.\r\nPlease keep that in mind before posting issues and PRs.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[MIT License](http://ivanhoinacki.mit-license.org/) Â© Ivan Hoinacki\r\n",
